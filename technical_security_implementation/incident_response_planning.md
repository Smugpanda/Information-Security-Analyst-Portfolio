## Incident Response Planning

**Executive Summary:**

This document outlines the incident response plan developed to effectively respond to security incidents, minimize damage, and ensure business continuity. The plan covers all stages of the incident response lifecycle, defines roles and responsibilities, and provides playbooks for common incident types. Regular testing and review ensure the plan's effectiveness.

**1. Incident Response Lifecycle:**

The incident response process follows these key stages:

*   **Preparation:** Establishing policies, procedures, and training for incident response.
*   **Identification:** Detecting and analyzing potential security incidents.
*   **Containment:** Limiting the scope and impact of the incident.
*   **Eradication:** Removing the root cause of the incident.
*   **Recovery:** Restoring affected systems and data to normal operation.
*   **Lessons Learned:** Documenting the incident and identifying areas for improvement.

**2. Roles and Responsibilities:**

*   **Security Analyst:** Responsible for analyzing security incidents and identifying the root cause.
*   **Communication Manager:** Responsible for communicating with internal and external stakeholders.

**3. Incident Classification:**

Incidents are classified based on severity and impact:

*   **High Severity:** Incidents that have a significant impact on business operations or data security.
*   **Medium Severity:** Incidents that have a moderate impact on business operations or data security.
*   **Low Severity:** Incidents that have a minimal impact on business operations or data security.

**4. Playbooks:**

Playbooks provide step-by-step instructions for responding to common security incidents:

*   **Payment Card Data Breach:**
    1.  Immediately isolate affected systems from the network.
    2.  Notify the payment processor and acquiring bank.
    3.  Engage a qualified forensic investigator to determine the scope of the breach.
    4.  Implement containment measures to prevent further data loss.
    5.  Notify affected customers and regulatory agencies as required.
*   **PHI Disclosure:**
    1.  Immediately contain the breach and prevent further disclosure.
    2.  Assess the scope of the disclosure and identify the individuals affected.
    3.  Notify affected individuals and regulatory agencies as required.
    4.  Implement corrective actions to prevent future disclosures.
*   **Ransomware Attack:**
    1.  Immediately isolate affected systems from the network.
    2.  Attempt to identify the ransomware variant.
    3.  Determine if a decryption key is available.
    4.  Restore affected systems from backups.
*   **VoIP Call Interception:**
    1.  Identify the source and destination of the intercepted calls.
    2.  Implement measures to prevent further call interceptions.
    3.  Review VoIP system configuration for security vulnerabilities.

**5. Key Metrics:**

*   Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) < 1hr
*   Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) < 4hrs

**6. Testing and Validation:**

*   Conducted quarterly tabletop exercises to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan.

**7. Tools and Technologies:**

*   SIEM system for security incident detection and analysis.
*   Firewall and intrusion detection/prevention systems for network security.
*   Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for endpoint security.

**8. Communication Plan:**

*   Internal communication: Incident Response Team, Management
*   External communication: Customers, Legal Counsel, Law Enforcement

**9. Maintenance and Review:**

*   The incident response plan is reviewed and updated annually, or more frequently as needed.

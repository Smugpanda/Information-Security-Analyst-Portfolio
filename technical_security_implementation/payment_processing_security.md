## Payment Processing Security

**Executive Summary:**

This document outlines the technical security measures implemented to protect payment card data and ensure compliance with PCI DSS requirements. These measures enhance payment processing security, protect sensitive cardholder data, and ensure ongoing compliance with PCI DSS requirements.

**Technologies Used:**

*   Clover POS Systems (Model: Clover Mini)
*   Authorize.Net Payment Gateway
*   Payment Depot (Tokenization Provider)

**Security Measures:**

*   **Enabled EMV chip reader functionality on Clover POS systems:**
    *   *Rationale:* Reduces card-present fraud by requiring chip-based transactions (PCI DSS Requirement 8.2).
    *   *Configuration:* Configured Clover devices to prioritize EMV chip transactions over magnetic stripe transactions.
*   **Activated Clover Security Package (TransArmor solution):**
    *   *Rationale:* Provides tamper alerts and end-to-end encryption to protect cardholder data (PCI DSS Requirement 3.4).
    *   *Configuration:* Enabled tamper detection and configured end-to-end encryption for all Clover devices.
*   **Configured Authorize.Net fraud filters:**
    *   *Rationale:* Prevents fraudulent transactions by validating cardholder information and detecting suspicious activity (PCI DSS Requirement 4.1).
    *   *Configuration:* Enabled AVS, CVV validation, and velocity controls with specific thresholds.
*   **Implemented payment tokenization via Payment Depot:**
    *   *Rationale:* Protects sensitive cardholder data by replacing it with a non-sensitive token (PCI DSS Requirement 3.3).
    *   *Configuration:* Integrated Payment Depot's tokenization API into the payment processing workflow.

**PCI DSS Compliance:**

*   Completed SAQ D annually to assess and validate compliance with PCI DSS requirements (covering all systems involved in the payment processing lifecycle).
*   Engaged an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) to conduct quarterly external vulnerability scans.
*   Maintained up-to-date documentation of firewall rules.
*   Submitted Attestation of Compliance (AOC) to the acquiring bank or payment processor.

**Configuration Examples:**

```

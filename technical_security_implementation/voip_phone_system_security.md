## VoIP Phone System Security

**Executive Summary:**

This document outlines the technical security measures implemented to protect the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone system from unauthorized access and eavesdropping. These measures enhance communication security, protect sensitive information, and ensure business continuity by preventing unauthorized access, detecting and blocking malicious activity, and providing continuous security monitoring.

**Technologies Used:**

*   [Redacted VoIP Provider] (Cloud-Based VoIP System)

**Security Measures:**

*   **Encrypted voice traffic with SRTP/TLS to protect the confidentiality of calls:**
    *   *Rationale:* Protects voice communications from eavesdropping and interception (HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.312(e)(1)).
    *   *Configuration:* Enabled SRTP with AES-128 encryption and TLS 1.2 for signaling using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite.
*   **Implemented network access controls to restrict access to the VoIP system:**
    *   *Rationale:* Prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the VoIP network (HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.308(a)(3)(i)).
    *   *Configuration:* Implemented VLAN segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to the VoIP system to authorized devices only.
*   **Enabled multi-factor authentication for the VoIP admin portal to prevent unauthorized access to the system's configuration:**
    *   *Rationale:* Adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to the system's configuration (HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D)).
    *   *Configuration:* Enforced multi-factor authentication for all administrator accounts using Google Authenticator.
*   **Monitored call logs for unusual patterns to detect fraud and other security incidents:**
    *   *Rationale:* Detects fraudulent activity and other security incidents (HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D)).
    *   *Configuration:* Configured call logging to capture call details, such as source and destination numbers, call duration, and call type, and used a SIEM solution for real-time monitoring and alerting.

**Configuration Examples:**

```bash
# Example access control list
permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
deny ip any any
```

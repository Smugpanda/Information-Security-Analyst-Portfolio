## Vulnerability Management

**Executive Summary:**

This document outlines the technical measures implemented to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. These measures enhance data security, protect sensitive information, and ensure compliance with security standards by proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

**Technologies Used:**

*   Nessus Vulnerability Scanner
*   [Redacted Patch Management System] (Cloud-Based System)

**Security Measures:**

*   **Conducted quarterly internal vulnerability scans using Nessus:**
    *   *Rationale:* Proactively identifies security vulnerabilities in the organization's systems.
    *   *Configuration:* Configured Nessus to scan all systems on the network, including servers, workstations, and network devices. Scan results are analyzed and tracked using a dedicated vulnerability management platform with automated reporting.
*   **Automated patch management to ensure that systems are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches:**
    *   *Rationale:* Reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
    *   *Configuration:* Configured the patch management system to automatically download and install security patches on a weekly basis. Patches are prioritized based on CVSS score and vendor criticality ratings.
*   **Conducted penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the organization's systems:**
    *   *Rationale:* Provides a realistic assessment of the organization's security posture.
    *   *Configuration:* Engaged a qualified penetration tester to conduct annual external penetration tests of the organization's systems. The penetration tester follows the OWASP Testing Guide methodology.

**Configuration Examples:**

```python
# Sample patch scheduling script
import schedule
def security_patches():
    run_os_update()
    restart_services()

schedule.every().wednesday.at("02:00").do(security_patches)
```

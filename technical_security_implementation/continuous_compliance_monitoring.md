## Continuous Compliance Monitoring

**Executive Summary:**

This document outlines the automated checks and documentation framework implemented to continuously monitor compliance with PCI DSS and HIPAA requirements. The continuous compliance monitoring program is reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed.

**Technologies Used:**

*   OSSEC (File Integrity Monitoring)
*   Elk Stack (Log Analysis)
*   Ansible (Configuration Drift Detection)

**Automated Checks:**

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (OSSEC):**
    *   *How:* OSSEC is deployed as an agent on all servers and workstations handling cardholder data and/or PHI. It monitors critical system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, web server configuration files, application binaries) for unauthorized changes by creating a baseline hash of each file and comparing it against subsequent hashes.  The configuration is managed centrally via the OSSEC server. Baseline hashes are stored in a secure, encrypted database with strict access controls. False positives are handled by a dedicated security analyst who investigates each alert and whitelists legitimate changes.
    *   *Why:* This helps detect malware infections, unauthorized modifications by insiders, and configuration errors that could weaken security, all of which are critical for PCI DSS and HIPAA compliance. (PCI DSS Requirement 11.5, HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D))
    *   *Example:* An alert would be triggered (and sent to the security team via email and Slack) if a user modifies a web server configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf`) without proper authorization, potentially opening the website to vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS).  The alert includes the user who made the change, the timestamp, and the specific changes detected.
*   **Log Analysis (ELK Stack):**
    *   *How:* The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) collects logs from various systems (firewalls, servers, applications) using Logstash shippers.  Logstash parses and enriches the logs before sending them to Elasticsearch for indexing and analysis. Kibana is used to visualize the data and create dashboards. Logs are retained for one year to meet compliance requirements.
    *   *Why:* This enables early detection of security incidents, policy violations, and system anomalies, providing valuable insights for incident response and compliance reporting. (PCI DSS Requirement 10.5, HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D))
    *   *Example:* An alert would be triggered if there's a sudden spike (more than 5 within 15 minutes) in failed login attempts from a specific IP address, indicating a potential brute-force attack. This alert is correlated with firewall logs to automatically block the offending IP address. We have configured threshold-based alerts, anomaly-based alerts, and signature-based alerts.
*   **Configuration Drift Detection (Ansible):**
    *   *How:* Ansible playbooks define the desired state of system configurations.  Ansible regularly (e.g., daily) checks the configuration of systems against this defined baseline configuration using `ansible-playbook --check`. Baseline configurations are stored in a version-controlled repository (Git) with strict access controls.
    *   *Why:* This ensures that systems are configured according to security best practices (e.g., CIS benchmarks) and that no unauthorized configuration changes have been made, maintaining a consistent and secure environment. (PCI DSS Requirement 2.2, HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C))
    *   *Example:* An alert would be triggered if a server's firewall rules are modified to allow unauthorized access to a sensitive port (e.g., opening port 3389 for RDP access from the internet).  The alert includes the specific rule changes and the user who initiated the change. Deviations from the baseline are automatically remediated by running the appropriate Ansible playbook to revert the changes.

**Documentation Framework:**

*   Aligned security controls with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).
*   Considered implementing the controls in ISO 27001 Annex A.
*   Utilized the PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) workbook to document compliance with PCI DSS requirements.
*   Employed a HIPAA Security Rule checklist to document compliance with HIPAA requirements.

**Reporting and Actionable Insights:**

*   Daily reports are generated from the ELK Stack dashboards, summarizing key security metrics (e.g., number of security incidents, failed login attempts, configuration changes).
*   These reports are reviewed by the security team to identify trends, investigate incidents, and improve the organization's security posture.
*   The data is also used to generate compliance reports for PCI DSS and HIPAA audits.

**Compliance Scope:**

*   This continuous compliance monitoring program covers all systems and data within the cardholder data environment (CDE) and those systems that store, process, or transmit PHI.

## Project Overview

This project involved enhancing the security posture of an organization by addressing key security and compliance requirements. The project encompassed various security domains, including network security, payment processing security, VoIP protection, website security, HIPAA compliance, vulnerability management, incident response planning, and continuous compliance monitoring.

## Project Goals

*   Enhance the overall security posture of the organization.
*   Implement security controls to protect sensitive data.
*   Achieve and maintain compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations (PCI DSS, HIPAA).
*   Develop and implement security policies and procedures.
*   Automate security monitoring and incident response processes.

## Key Contributions

As an Information Security Analyst, I was responsible for:

*   Developing and implementing security policies and procedures.
*   Designing and implementing technical security controls.
*   Conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
*   Managing security incidents and responding to security alerts.
*   Automating security monitoring and compliance checks.
*   Providing security awareness training to employees.
